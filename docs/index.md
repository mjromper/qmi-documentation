# Qlik Machine Images (QMI)

QMI is a tool for building environments in an automated, reproducible way. By using simple workflows, multiple environments can be started consistently and reliably, removing the time to build and keep environments up to date.  This deployment method allows the focus to be on the product, not the installation and configuration.

Please see the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page for further details.
